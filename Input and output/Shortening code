~typedef long long ll;
After this, the code
```
long long a = 123456789;
long long b = 987654321;
cout << a*b << "\n";
```
can be shortened as follows:
```
ll a = 123456789;
ll b = 987654321;
cout << a*b << "\n";
```
The command typedef can also be used with more complex types. For example,
the following code gives the name vi for a vector of integers and the name pi for
a pair that contains two integers.
typedef vector<int> vi;
typedef pair<int,int> pi;
