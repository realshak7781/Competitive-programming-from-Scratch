~Σx = 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n = n(n+1)/2
Σx^2 = 1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + ... + n^2 = n(n+1)(2n+1)/6


a + ... + b | {z}
            n numbers
=
n(a + b)/2


~Harmonic sum and the upper bound
An upper bound for a harmonic sum is log2
(n) + 1. Namely, we can modify
each term 1/k so that k becomes the nearest power of two that does not exceed k.
