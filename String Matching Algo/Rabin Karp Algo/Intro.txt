**Rabin-Karp** is a clever string matching algorithm that uses hashing to find a pattern (needle) in a text (haystack).
It computes hash values to quickly compare substrings, making it efficient for multiple pattern searches.
You should learn it because it introduces rolling hash concepts, useful in plagiarism detection, document search, and many coding interviews.
