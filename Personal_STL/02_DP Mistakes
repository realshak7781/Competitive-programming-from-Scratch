⚠️ Common Mistake: Using s.substr(i) + unordered_map<string, int> for DP
Problem:

Using s.substr(i) in recursive calls and memoizing with unordered_map<string, int> causes excessive memory usage.
Why it's bad:
• s.substr(i) creates new heap-allocated strings → leads to O(N²) copies for a string of length N.
• Using string as a key in a map stores duplicate overlapping substrings → results in high memory (MLE).
Better Approach:
✅ Use indices (start, end) instead of substrings.

✅ Memoize using a vector dp or dp[start][end] if needed.
