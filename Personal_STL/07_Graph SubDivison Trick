### General Note on Approach for "Reachable Nodes In Subdivided Graph"

1. Graph Representation:
- Treat edges [u, v, cnt] as weighted edges with weight cnt + 1.
- cnt accounts for intermediate nodes.
- +1 accounts for the direct connection between u and v.

2. Use Dijkstra's Algorithm:
- Start from node 0 and compute the shortest distance to all other original nodes.
- Track remaining moves (maxMoves - dist[u]) at each node.

3. Count Reachable Nodes:
- Original Nodes: Count all nodes whose shortest distance â‰¤ maxMoves.
- Intermediate Nodes: For each edge [u, v, cnt]:
- Calculate how far you can reach from u toward v (remaining_u = maxMoves - dist[u]).
- Calculate how far you can reach from v toward u (remaining_v = maxMoves - dist[v]).
- Total reachable intermediate nodes = min(cnt, remaining_u + remaining_v).

4. Avoid Double Counting:
- Ensure intermediate nodes are not counted twice (once from u and once from v).

5. Output:
- Sum up the counts of reachable original and intermediate nodes.

### Key Observations:
- Use weights to avoid explicitly subdividing the graph.
- Dijkstra's algorithm efficiently handles weighted edges and large graphs.
- Intermediate nodes are counted based on remaining moves without simulating them explicitly.

---

### Complexity:
- Time: $O((V + E) \log V)$, where $V$ is the number of nodes and $E$ is the number of edges.
- Space: $O(V + E)$ for the adjacency list and priority queue.

---

### Why This Approach Works:
- Compact representation using weights avoids large graph sizes.
- Efficient traversal and counting using Dijkstra's algorithm.
- Simplifies intermediate node counting by leveraging remaining moves.
