Whenever a problem gives you pairwise connections or dislikes and asks if it's possible to divide elements into two groups with some constraint like:"No two connected items should be in the same group"
‚û°Ô∏è Think of it as a Bipartite Graph problem.
‚úÖ Clues that hint it's a Bipartite Graph problem:
‚Ä¢ Input is given as pairs, edges, or dislikes.
‚Ä¢ You are asked to split into 2 groups such that:
    ‚ó¶ Connected nodes go into different groups.
    ‚ó¶ No conflicts inside the same group.
‚úÖ What to do:
1. Model the connections as a graph.
2. Use DFS or BFS to color the graph using 2 colors (or 0 and 1).
3. If any two adjacent nodes have the same color ‚Üí not bipartite.
üí° Examples:
‚Ä¢ LeetCode 886: Possible Bipartition
‚Ä¢ LeetCode 785: Is Graph Bipartite?
‚Ä¢ Social network ‚Äúfriend/enemy‚Äù groupings
